Iâ€™m now a third-year undergraduate student in the Department of Applied Psychology, Nanjing University. I am interested in social competition and social cognition. I plan to explore the relationship between stigma and social competition. I have a wide range of hobbies, such as photography, traveling, dancing and playing badminton.
