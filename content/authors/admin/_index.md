I am a Principal Investigator in the Institute for Brain Sciences and at the Department of Psychology, Nanjing University, China. I received my master degree in Psychology in the State Key Lab of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University. Then I went to Cognitive Neurology Group at Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research as a guest internship and a Ph.D student.  I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience from CNRS and pursued my postdoc in the same lab in Lyon, France.\
I am interested in neuropsychological mechanisms underlying human social behaviors and how competition influences these processes.\
